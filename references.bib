  abstract = {Sensor systems typically operate under resource constraints that prevent the simultaneous use of all resources all of the time. Sensor management becomes relevant when the sensing system has the capability of actively managing these resources; i.e., changing its operating configuration during deployment in reaction to previous measurements. Examples of systems in which sensor management is currently used or is likely to be used in the near future include autonomous robots, surveillance and reconnaissance networks, and waveform-agile radars. This paper provides an overview of the theory, algorithms, and applications of sensor management as it has developed over the past decades and as it stands today.},

Sensors that are agile and support multiple modes of operation require adaptive scheduling approaches in order to yield performance benefits compared to fixed off-line approaches. User objectives for different types of tasks must be carefully defined in order to ensure appropriate allotment of sensor resources. Myopic scheduling approaches concentrate on present sensing actions only, while non-myopic scheduling approaches concentrate on present and future actions. In this paper, two different algorithms are developed for the rolling horizon, or multiple time step look-ahead, non-myopic scheduling problem. An example of a multifunction electronically scanned radar that is tasked to (i) search for targets and (ii) update tracks on targets is used to show how the algorithms can be applied in practice.},

So it is urgent to study the intelligent radar confrontation (IRC) method. Based on this, this paper expounds the intelligent radar confrontation method, and compares the difference between traditional radar confrontation (TRC) and intelligent radar confrontation. Aiming at the problem of single function and poor real-time performance in the process of conventional radar confrontation, IRC based on reinforcement learning (RL) is studied, and the formula of Q value updating in IRC process is deduced. The simulation shows that the intelligent radar jamming method can independently learn and make decision according to the jamming effect, improving the adaptability of the radar countermeasure system, and can resist the multi-working mode radar simultaneously.},

Three ingredients are basic to the constitution of cognitive radar: 1) intelligent signal processing, which builds on learning through interactions of the radar with the surrounding environment; 2) feedback from the receiver to the transmitter, which is a facilitator of intelligence; and 3) preservation of the information content of radar returns, which is realized by the Bayesian approach to target detection through tracking. All three of these ingredients feature in the echo-location system of a bat, which may be viewed as a physical realization (albeit in neurobiological terms) of cognitive radar. Radar is a remote-sensing system that is widely used for surveillance, tracking, and imaging applications, for both civilian and military needs. In this article, we focus on future possibilities of radar with particular emphasis on the issue of cognition. As an illustrative case study along the way, we consider the problem of radar surveillance applied to an ocean environment.},

Specifically, under restriction of a fixed energy budget, the authors devote to minimise the loss, which is caused by the unsuccessfully intercepted missiles, through optimal power allocation (OPA) of MSRS within multiple stages. The design of OPA can be translated into a sequential decision-making problem. The authors formulate the problem through variable definition and modelling the missile interception procedure. As the authors need to consider the randomness of multiple coupled stages and jointly allocation power between multiple radar nodes, to solve the proposed problem is of huge computational load. The authors propose a solution that combines with reinforcement learning and particle swarm optimisation. Comparing with the uniform power allocation scheme, the simulation results demonstrate that the OPA scheme designed by the proposed method is capable to achieve preferable and more stable performance for the whole missile interception. The authors' contributions include a novel optimisation resource management model for a multi-stage stochastic task and an effective solution for the optimal resource management scheme.},

The optimal jamming power allocation problem is solved by proposing a multi-stage jamming power allocation method based on model-free reinforcement learning. Firstly, we construct a Markov decision process (MDP) with unknown environment model for multi-stage jamming power allocation. To evaluate the performance of multi-stage smart noise jamming, we choose the expected of the search to lock-on time of the FCR as an evaluation criterion. Then, to overcome the challenge of the unknown environment model, a reinforcement learning framework for multi-stage jamming power allocation is formulated. Under the framework, a method of multi-stage jamming power allocation based on Q-learning is proposed. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the validity of the proposed method.},

A cognitive radar network may achieve these challenges by fully exploiting the available radar resources, sharing data among network components and taking into account prior environmental and situational knowledge as well as experience accumulated during operations. This knowledge can vary from high level information such as intelligence about the threat to low level information such as clutter maps. This paper presents a cognitive radar network architecture that supports this functionality and the application of (self)-learning methods.

The proposed policies stem from the stochastic non-stationary restless multi-armed bandit formulation of opportunistic spectrum access. The non-stationary radio environment assumed in this paper is an appropriate model for a realistic cognitive radio systems, where the obtainable data rates depend on many unknown time-varying factors. These are e.g. mobility, fading and primary user activity. The developed policies are index policies, where the index of a frequency band depends on the discounted average reward of the band and a recency-based exploration bonus. The exploration bonus encourages sensing frequency bands that have not been explored for a long time. However, there is a maximum number of time instances when any band can remain unexplored. These index policies are computationally simple making them attractive for mobile cognitive radios. In our simulation examples, we demonstrate that the proposed policies can often provide higher cumulative data rate than other existing state-of-the-art policies.},

An optimal subset of active antennas of predetermined size, K, is selected such that the localization mean-square error (MSE) is minimized. The problem is formulated in a combinatorial optimization framework as a knapsack problem (KP). The Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) is used as a performance metric. Cost parameters, representing operational cost or any other utilization constraints, are associated with each of the antennas. These are incorporated into the KP formulation, integrating decision making factors in the selection process. Antenna subset selection is implemented through an approximation algorithm, by successively selecting antennas so as to maximize the temporal Fisher information matrix (FIM) for a given subset size. The proposed approximation algorithm offers considerable reduction in computational complexity when compared with exhaustive search, supporting distributive processing and low performance loss.},

The stochastic nature of the wireless propagation medium and random variations in the utilization and operating environment of the device makes it difficult to estimate and predict wireless channels and power consumption levels. Therefore, we investigate a robust antenna subset selection policy where the power-normalized throughput is assumed to be drawn from an unknown distribution with unknown mean. At each time instant, the transceiver decides upon the active antenna subset based on observations of the outcomes of previous choices, with the objective being to identify the optimal antenna subset which maximizes the power-normalized throughput. In this work, we present a sequential learning scheme to achieve this based on the theory of multi-armed bandits. Simulations verify that the proposed novel method that accounts for dependent arms outperforms a naive approach designed for independent arms in terms of regret.},

In order to utilize the benefits of reconfigurable antennas, selecting an optimal antenna state for communication is essential and depends on the availability of full channel state information for all the available antenna states. We consider the problem of reconfigurable antenna state selection in a single user MIMO system. We first formulate the state selection as a multi-armed bandit problem that aims to optimize arbitrary link quality metrics. We then show that by using online learning under a multi-armed bandit framework, a sequential decision policy can be employed to learn optimal antenna states without instantaneous full CSI and without a priori knowledge of wireless channel statistics. Our objective is to devise an adaptive state selection technique when the channels corresponding to all the states are not directly observable and compare our results against the case of a known model or genie with full information. We evaluate the performance of the proposed antenna state selection technique by identifying key link quality metrics and using measured channels in a 2 × 2 MIMO OFDM system. We show that the proposed technique maximizes long term link performance with reduced channel training frequency.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a spectrum sensing policy employing recency-based exploration is proposed for cognitive radio networks. We formulate the problem of finding a spectrum sensing policy for multiband dynamic spectrum access as a stochastic restless multiarmed bandit problem with stationary unknown reward distributions. In cognitive radio networks, the multiarmed bandit problem arises when deciding where in the radio spectrum to look for idle frequencies that could be efficiently exploited for data transmission. We consider two models for the dynamics of the frequency bands: 1) the independent model where the state of the band evolves randomly independently from the past and 2) the Gilbert-Elliot model, where the states evolve according to a two-state Markov chain. It is shown that, in these conditions, the proposed sensing policy attains asymptotically logarithmic weak regret. The policy proposed in this paper is an index policy, in which the index of a frequency band comprises a sample mean term and a recency-based exploration bonus term. The sample mean promotes spectrum exploitation, whereas the exploration bonus encourages further exploration for idle bands providing high data rates. The proposed recency-based approach readily allows constructing the exploration bonus such that it will grow the time interval between consecutive sensing time instants of a suboptimal band exponentially, which then leads to logarithmically increasing weak regret. Simulation results confirming logarithmic weak regret are presented, and it is found that the proposed policy provides often improved performance at low complexity over other state-of-the-art policies in the literature.},

Obviously, random frequency hopping is not the best choice if the radar can learn the jammer' strategy. In this paper, a novel frequency hopping strategy design method is proposed for cognitive radar to defeat the smart jammer, in which the radar does not know the exact jamming model. Q-learning and deep Q-network (DQN) is utilized to solve this problem. By applying the reinforcement learning algorithm, the radar is able to learn the jammer's strategies through the interaction with environment and adopt the best action to obtain high reward. The learning performance of DQN is much better than that of Q-learning especially when the available frequencies are large. The proposed method can improve the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for the radar when the jamming model is not available. Numerical results are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

While, in a general sense, MIMO radar can be viewed as a type of multistatic radar, the separate nomenclature suggests unique features that set MIMO radar apart from the multistatic radar literature and that have a close relation to MIMO communications. This article reviews some recent work on MIMO radar with widely separated antennas. Widely separated transmit/receive antennas capture the spatial diversity of the target's radar cross section (RCS). Unique features of MIMO radar are explained and illustrated by examples. It is shown that with noncoherent processing, a target's RCS spatial variations can be exploited to obtain a diversity gain for target detection and for estimation of various parameters, such as angle of arrival and Doppler. For target location, it is shown that coherent processing can provide a resolution far exceeding that supported by the radar's waveform.},

Due to their complexities, and the uncertainty of the smart grid and high volume of information being collected, artificial intelligence techniques represent some of the enabling technologies for its future development and success. Owing to the decreasing cost of computing power, the profusion of data, and better algorithms, AI has entered into its new developmental stage and AI 2.0 is developing rapidly. Deep learning (DL), reinforcement learning (RL) and their combination-deep reinforcement learning (DRL) are representative methods and relatively mature methods in the family of AI 2.0. This article introduces the concept and status quo of the above three methods, summarizes their potential for application in smart grids, and provides an overview of the research work on their application in smart grids.},

abstract={Reinforcement learning offers to robotics a framework and set of tools for the design of sophisticated and hard-to-engineer behaviors. Conversely, the challenges of robotic problems provide both inspiration, impact, and validation for developments in reinforcement learning. The relationship between disciplines has sufficient promise to be likened to that between physics and mathematics. In this article, we attempt to strengthen the links between the two research communities by providing a survey of work in reinforcement learning for behavior generation in robots. We highlight both key challenges in robot reinforcement learning as well as notable successes. We discuss how contributions tamed the complexity of the domain and study the role of algorithms, representations, and prior knowledge in achieving these successes. As a result, a particular focus of our paper lies on the choice between model-based and model-free as well as between value-function-based and policy-search methods. By analyzing a simple problem in some detail we demonstrate how reinforcement learning approaches may be profitably applied, and we note throughout open questions and the tremendous potential for future research.},

A non-myopic approach based on reinforcement learning is developed in order to maximize information gain for the long term. Reinforcement learning adjusts optimal control policy and learns system behaviors through trial-and-error experience from interactions with a dynamic environment. System states are characterized by the expected information gain, action-value functions are estimated by online SARAR (lambda) algorithm and parameterized control policy is approximated by neural networks. Finally, simulations show that non-myopic approach after sufficient training can provide better performance than myopic approach.},

Such sensors typically have competing demands on limited sensor resources such as the sensor timeline. Sensor management systems attempt to meet the overall goal of the sensor user by considering the user's priorities and the capabilities of the sensor. This paper describes an algorithm for scheduling an electronically scanned array radar in order to perform the two functions of (i) searching for new targets and (ii) updating tracks on known targets. A previous formulation considered search theory approaches to determine radar dwell times. This formulation is extended from the search problem to address the tracking or update function for known targets. A key feature of the scheduling formulation permits the sensor user to specify the costs of not detecting targets within a surveillance volume and of not updating tracks on known targets. A single cost function is used to determine a myopic radar schedule that is optimised using an interior point method. A simple example of a dynamically evolving target environment is used to illustrate the allocation of radar timeline for search and tracking functions.},

In this work, it is argued that the cognitive characteristic of anticipation can also enhance radar performance. In this paper it is shown that radar management using a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) enables the radar to act with anticipation. A method using policy rollout is applied to approximate a POMDP for a target tracking control problem. Through a simulated example it is demonstrated how the anticipative method departs from a purely adaptive approach, and the subsequent improvement in performance is quantified.},

The purpose of this IMM algorithm is twofold: to estimate and predict the target states; and to estimate the level of the dynamic process noise. The estimate of the process-noise level is used to determine the update interval adapted to the changing target dynamics. The update interval is determined so that the number of track updates per unit time in reflection of beam-positioning losses can be reduced. The proposed algorithm is implemented for a phased-array radar tracking and evaluated with Monte Carlo simulations on various trajectories. The evaluation results of the proposed algorithm are presented and compared with the results of the 'cube-root filter'.<>},

This paper presents a simple fast algorithm to determine the next update time for track update in phased array radar. This algorithm is based on the interacting multiple models (IMM) algorithm which is appropriate for manoeuvring targets tracking. The IMM is used here to predict and estimate the target's possible states and to select the correct next update time. The idea is to assign to each model in the IMM algorithm an appropriate rate and to weight these rates by the models' probabilities to obtain the rate to use. The resulting algorithm is named the fast adaptive interacting multiple models (FAIMM algorithm). The performances of this algorithm are compared to that of the adaptive IMM algorithm that uses Van Keuk criterion to select the next update time and to that of the IMM algorithm that uses a constant update time},

In the target tracking, the tasks are required to be executed to consider the maneuvering motion, measurement condition and required tracking performance. Frequent execution of tracking tasks results in not only precise tracking, but also waste of timing resource which is shared with other functions. Therefore, to reduce the number of unnecessary observations, the tracking task is required to be executed only when the update is needed. In this paper, the innovation, position residual, in Kalman filter is used as reference value for adjusting update rate of tracking tasks. Using feedback controller, the update rate is allocated so that predicted observation is expected to be within specified error range. In addition, targets are classified into 7 priorities according to tactical characteristics, and target's priority is also used as reference value for calculating update rate. The simulation results show that the proposed method reduces the tracking error of the target on maneuvering movement compared to fixed update rate case.},

The update rate is closely related with the level of target maneuvering and the required quality of tracking performance - the shorter the time intervals between two successive updates, the better the radar resources are made use of. Considering the needs of the phased-array radar system and multi-function tracking, we here propose an algorithm which makes a better use of radar resources; therefore, many targets can be tracked with an improved accuracy, and more regions can be detected. The proposed algorithm is based upon the adaptive interactive tracking algorithm (AIMM); the revisit time has been calculated using Van Keuk method, and then the fast AIMM has been amended such that the tracking error is no more than that in Van Keuk method. Our proposed algorithm which has a revisit time different than Van Keuk’s results in 62% saving of the radar resources},

The resource manager of the radar must then control the update rate of the measurement task of target active tracking, so as to minimise the radar computer load without losing targets. Scarce measurements lead to low radar load, but they also lead to an increased number of illuminations at each measurement epoch to find the target. On the basis of this rationale, a sound procedure was proposed by Blackman and van Keuk to derive an optimal measurement rate. Their optimisation criterion is established using a linear Singer target model and a linear Kalman filter. In this study, their method is extended, and the authors propose a versatile optimal update rate algorithm that is applicable to virtually any non-linear target model combined with any non-linear filter able to output an error covariance matrix. This includes extended Kalman filter (EKF), Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF), Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) algorithm, and particle filters. For numerical experiments and validation, they consider a non-linear target model based on Frenet-Serret three-dimensional equations, and the tracking is performed by a non-linear invariant EKF.},

  abstract  = {Since phased array radars have the ability to perform adaptive sampling of the target trajectory by the radar beam positioning, proper control of the radar has the potential for significantly improving many aspects associated with the tracking of multiple manoeuvring targets. The technique proposed in this paper uses the interacting multiple model (IMM) algorithm to track manoeuvring targets and control the revisit time, and pointing, and adjust the energy level of the radar. Since the output of the IMM algorithm better represents the accuracy of the state estimates during a manoeuvre than that of a single model filter, the IMM algorithm is used to compute an online measure of tracking performance to determine the revisit time of the next track update in order to maintain a given level of performance. The revisit time is computed as the one positive root of a polynomial equation of the sample period. The model probabilities of the IMM algorithm are also used to schedule the energy level of a radar dwell. As a result, the revisit times are a function of track filter performance and the target trajectory. Algorithms for computing the revisit time, pointing the radar, and adjusting the energy level using the output of the IMM algorithm are presented in this paper. Performance comparisons are given for the IMM algorithm using a constant data rate, adjusted energy levels, and an adaptive data rate.<>},

The main feature of this algorithm is its ability to estimate the state of a dynamic system with several behavior modes which can "switch" from one to another. In particular, the IMM estimator can be a self-adjusting variable-bandwidth filter, which makes it natural for tracking maneuvering targets. The importance of this approach is that it is the best compromise available currently-between complexity and performance: its computational requirements are nearly linear in the size of the problem (number of models) while its performance is almost the same as that of an algorithm with quadratic complexity. The objective of this work is to survey and put in perspective the existing IMM methods for target tracking problems. Special attention is given to the assumptions underlying each algorithm and its applicability to various situations.},

The tracking algorithm is based on the combination of the interacting multiple models (IMM) algorithm and the joint probabilistic data association filter (JPDAF), the resulting algorithm is named IMMJPDAF algorithm. Moreover, the phased array radar is a multifunction radar with the capability to select adaptively the sampling time interval; consequently, the tracking performance is improved. First, a complete comparative study between the IMMJPDAF algorithm and the multirate IMMJPDAF (MRIMMJPDAF) algorithm for tracking close manoeuvring targets with varying amounts of clutter density is presented. Then a description is made of the integration of a new fast method into the IMMJPDAF algorithm to adaptively select the next update time according to the targets motions. We call the resulting algorithm, the fast adaptive IMMJPDAF (FAIMMJPDAF) algorithm. Furthermore, an enhancement of the tracking accuracy in the FAIMMJPDAF algorithm is made by also taking into account the separation distance between targets in the selection of the next update time. The performance of the proposed algorithm, named improved fast adaptive IMMJPDAF (IFAIMMJPDAF) algorithm is assessed via Monte Carlo Simulations and compared with that of four algorithms that use an adaptive selection of the update time: FAIMMJPDAF algorithm, the adaptive IMMJPDAF that uses a modified version of the van Keuk criterion (MAIMMJPDAF), the adaptive IMMJPDAF that uses the original van Keuk method (AIMMJPDAF), and the IMMJPDAF (CIMMJPDAF) that uses a constant update time.},
